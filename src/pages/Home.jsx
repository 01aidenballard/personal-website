        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">About Me</h2>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          I am currently a Junior at West Virginia University studying Computer Science with a strong interest in software engineering and embedded systems. 
          As an undergraduate research assistant, I collaborated with Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering students to produce autonomous, target-tracking,  
          lighter-than-air drones (blimps, to the layman) for competition. I led the Vision subteam, where I focused on real-time object detection.
          I also contributed to a published research paper on embedded artificial intelligence, which detailed the creation of an AI Ambassador for West Virginia University's 
          Lane Department of Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (LCSEE). Feel free to check out these projects and more in my portfolio!
        </p>
        <p className="text-md leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
          Outside of programming, I love reading, gaming, and playing Ultimate Frisbee, a passion that has led me to serve as Vice President, Captain, and now President of WV Wild, 
          our universityâ€™s competitive Ultimate team.

            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              I have been trying to get into the Cosmere Universe for a long time and I finally found an available copy at my local bookstore. 
              Excited to finish this and move on through the rest of the Stormlight Archive. Kaladin is definitely the most entertaining character of the first 200 pages.

              GuiltyThree's <i>Shadow Slave</i>

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              For those that don't know webnovels, this is one of the best out there. I love GuiltyThree's writing style and am currently on chapter 2066. Here are my favorite arcs: Forgotten Shore, The Fall of Antarctica, and the Third Nightmare.
